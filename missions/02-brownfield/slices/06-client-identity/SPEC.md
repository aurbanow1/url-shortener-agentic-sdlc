# Slice 06 — Client Identity

## Intent

Client Identity

## Mini-requirements

1. [The concise one-glance requirement tier — numbered observable outcomes. For a small slice this may BE the whole plan.]

## Proof contract

- [ ] [One promised deliverable, written as an observable outcome — captured. Each item pairs with its proof via `rig proof add … --evidences` (media attached with `--media`); UI deliverables name their planned mockup.]

## Source material

- [Paths or refs]

## Intent visual

Non-visual slices: mark this section N/A.

- Intent image: ![Intent visual](./intent.png)
- Durable diff: [change.diff](./change.diff)
- Regenerate preview: from `packages/ui`, run `TWIN_ROUTE=<route> npm run twin:build` to rebuild `twin-out/intent.html` (gitignored).

## Status

- TODO: [next steps]

## Dependencies

- [Cross-slice / cross-release]

> **How you work this slice (SOP):** conventions SSOT: `docs/reference/sdlc-conventions.md` (installed: `$OPENRIG_HOME/reference/sdlc-conventions.md`) — read its COMPONENT MENU first: your mission chooses the build path (the simple default flow · the wave model · the assigned rigorous overlay) and the planning rigor (the P0–P4 dial); do not assume the heavy flow unless your mission or dispatch assigns it. Full flow for the default path: the `mission-slice-sop` skill. The floor on every path: track on PROGRESS.md; evidence lands via `rig proof add` (never hand-placed); a slice is **not done** until its promised outcomes have evidence; verify with `rig scope audit`.
